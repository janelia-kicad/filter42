BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS--<br>
This disk contains a DOS-compatible program to aid in active filter design and two graphics dump utilities. The programs are not Burr-Brown products, but application information intended to aid in using our components. They are easy to use, with helpful on-screen prompts. Just try them!

<blockquote>FILTER42 designs a wide variety of filters using Burr-Brown's UAF42 Universal Active Filter IC. This state-variable filter provides low-pass, high-pass and band-pass outputs. Notch filters can also be designed.
<br><br>
EGAHPRES and EGAFXRES are screen dump utilities that can print response plots on HP Laserjet and Epson printers, respectively. See "printing response plots."</blockquote>

SUPPORTING LITERATURE--<br>
Filter42 can be used without documentation. You will eventually need the Application Bulletin for circuit details. These are available free from Burr-Brown. You can request the printed bulletins by calling 1-800-548-6132 in the USA or by contacting your local Burr-Brown representative. Or, you can have the bulletins faxed directly to you (USA only) by calling our FaxLine at 1-800-548-6133 (use the special document numbers at the right).

HARDWARE NOTES<br>
These programs will run on virtually all PC-compatible computers. To<br>
display response plots, you need VGA (or EGA) graphics. If you do not<br>
have a graphics display, you can still use them, but you cannot display<br>
response plots.</P>
On some keyboards, the arrow keys will not work with Caps-lock and/or<br>
Num-lock; turn them off if the arrow keys don't work. Numbers should be<br>
typed on the main keyboard, not the numeric keypad.<br>
<br>
PRINTER OUTPUT<br>
Printer output (text only) for both programs works with any 80-column<br>
(or wider) printer. Printer output is directed to LPT1.<br>
<br>
PRINTING RESPONSE PLOTS<br>
There is no facility within the programs to print response plots. If<br>
you have a graphics screen-dump utility, try it. We have provided two<br>
simple screen-dump programs for your convenience. EGAHPRES is for HP<br>
Laserjet printers. EGAFXRES is for Epson-compatible printers. Both are<br>
memory-resident programs which work with EGA or VGA graphics displays.<br>
The appropriate program must be loaded prior to running the filter<br>
program by typing its file name. To print a graphics screen press<br>
&lt;Shift-Print-screen&gt; while the desired plot is displayed. If it works,<br>
consider it a bonus from Burr-Brown.<br>
<br>
MacIntosh COMPUTERS<br>
FilterPro programs are not available for the MacIntosh. A program<br>
called "SoftPC" from Insignia Solutions Inc emulates a PC in software.<br>
FILTER2 runs using this program, albeit very slow. To display response<br>
plots, you also need Insignia's EGA emulation program. The total cost<br>
of both programs runs hundreds of dollars. Perhaps you have other PC<br>
programs you would like to run on your MAC?<br>
<br>Various add-on hardware is available for MACs to allow running PC<br>
programs. These probably work, but have not been tested. The<br>
equivalent PC must have EGA, or VGA compatible graphics to display<br>
response plots.<br>
<br>
REVISION OF FILTER42 PROGRAM<br>
A previous version of FILTER42 (1.0) crashed on some computers. This<br>
has been corrected with version 1.1. There are no other functional<br>
changes in the program. Version 1.1 produces the same filter designs as<br>
version 1.0. Version 1.11 corrects some minor cosmetics in the program,<br>
only.<br></FONT></BODY>
